## HW (15) Analysis Plan

1. Independent variable Vignettes (two explanation levels X two social classes)
- 3 higher-class topic vignettes + 3 lower-class topic vignettes
- Each vignette has basic (detailed explanation) and neutral version (no explanation)

2. Dependent variable
- Listener’s knowledge rating (7-point Likert)
- Listener's social class rating (10-point Likert)
- Participant’s social class + knowledge of various topics

3. Analysis

A. Relationship between participant social class and knowledge
- Analysis: Correlation analysis for manipulation check ∙ for selecting topics for future study
- Plot: Scatter plot + fitted line visualizing the relationship
- Table: Correlation matrix with correlation coefficients, significance levels

B. Compare knowledge and social class ratings between conditions
- Analysis: ANOVA (among four groups) or Independent samples t-test (between two explanation conditions) to compare (1) average knowledge ratings (2) social class ratings
- Plots: (1) Histograms visualizing the data distribution (2) Bar graph showing the distribution of ratings for each condition
- Tables: (1) Descriptive statistics of means & standard deviations (2) Summary of ANOVA / t-test results

The study explores the relationship between participants' social class and their knowledge of various conversation topics. The social class of r nrow(data) individuals was measured on a 10-point likert scale (MacArthur Subjective SES ladder), and their knowledge across different topics (that are typically well-known by either higher or lower social class group) was assessed on a 7-point likert scale.

The analyses will reveal an average participant social class of r mean(dataset$participant_social_class, na.rm = TRUE), with a standard deviation of r sd(dataset$participant_social_class, na.rm = TRUE). Knowledge on the topics will show an average score of r mean(dataset$topic_knowledge, na.rm = TRUE), and a standard deviation of r sd(dataset$topic_knowledge, na.rm = TRUE).

The correlation test will indicate a significant relationship between social class and knowledge, with a correlation coefficient of r cor_test_result$estimate and a p-value of r cor_test_result$p.value. This will suggest that as participants' social class increases, their knowledge on higher-class common ground topics will also tend to increase, and vice versa.

A scatter plot will visualize this relationship with a fitted line indicating the direction and strength of the relationships. The correlation matrix will additionally reveal a coefficient of r cor_matrix["participant_social_class", "topic_knowledge"].

The findings will ultimately suggest that socioeconomic factors may indeed play a role in shaping individuals' cultivated knowledge of specific culture amd experiences.
