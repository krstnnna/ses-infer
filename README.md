**Description of data**
The survey showed two different personal narratives to participants and measured their perception of the narrator's socioeconomic status, their evaluation of the narrator, and their demographic backgrounds. Most questions were answered primarily using the Likert scale.

**Plan: Research question**
Do people accurately detect SES signals provided in personal narratives, and does this affect decision-making procedures by provoking specific stereotypes?
